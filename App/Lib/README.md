# Lib

At first glance, this could appear to be a "miscellaneous" folder, but we recommend that you treat this as proving 
ground for components that could be re-useable outside your project.

Maybe you're writing a set of utilities that you could use outside your project, but they're not quite ready or not 
 well tested yet, then this folder would be a great place to put them. They ideally be pure functions have no 
 dependencies on other things in your App folder.
